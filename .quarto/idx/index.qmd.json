This is my website where you can learn more about me and what I have been working on, please feel free to browse. I am currently a student at California Polytechnic State University, pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Statistics. I am passionate about data analytics, patterns, and trends. Although I'm still in the early stages of my academic journey, I am committed to learning more about analyzing data and applying them to the real-world. Outside of school, I love to dance! Through dance, I have learned valuable lessons in discipline, teamwork, and creativity. This website serves as a digital portfolio and a platform for me to showcase my academic projects, coursework, and personal achievements. \n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","editor":"source","theme":"flatly","title":"Seina Haruta","image":"Website Picture.png","about":{"template":"jolla","links":[{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/seina-haruta/"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/sharuta"},{"icon":"file-earmark-pdf-fill","text":"Resume","href":"SeinaHaruta/Seina_Haruta_Resume.pdf"}]},"resources":["Seina_Haruta_Resume.pdf"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
