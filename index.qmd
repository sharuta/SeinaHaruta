Welcome, my name is Seina Haruta! This is my website where you can learn more about me and what I have been working on, please feel free to browse. I am currently a student at California Polytechnic State University, pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Statistics. I am passionate about data analytics, patterns, and trends. Although I'm still in the early stages of my academic journey, I am committed to learning more about analyzing data and applying them to the real-world. Outside of school, I love to dance! Through dance, I have learned valuable lessons in discipline, teamwork, and creativity. This website serves as a digital portfolio and a platform for me to showcase my academic projects, coursework, and personal achievements.
